# Facial_Keypoints-Kears
In this project, youâ€™ll combine your knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face!
That was Task for UDACITY - Computer Vision Nanodegree  students by pytorch , i I took data from https:https://github.com/udacity/P1_Facial_Keypoints and implent it with kears
